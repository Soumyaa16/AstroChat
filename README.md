# AstroChat : Enhancing Astronomical Understanding Using an NLP-based Interactive Chatbot
AstroChat is an advanced NLP-based chatbot aimed at improving efficiency and accessibility in astronomical search. Powered by the T5 transformer model, AstroChat offers a user-friendly interface for enthusiasts, facilitating a smoother exploration of the universe.

## Features
+ NLP-powered Chatbot: Utilizes the T5 transformer model for natural language processing, enabling accurate and insightful responses to user queries.
+ User-friendly Interface: Designed with a focus on accessibility, providing a seamless experience for users exploring astronomical knowledge.

## Getting Started
To get started with AstroChat, follow these steps:
+ Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Soumyaa16/AstroChat.git
+ Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## To Run on Local Host 
Use following commands:
### For fast api: 
 - cd api-fast/
 - uvicorn main:app --reload

### For svelte:
 - cd front-svelte/
 - npm run dev

This project was originally developed collaboratively with 2 more peers and is hosted at (https://github.com/Soumyaa16/AstroChat).
While the GitHub contributor list reflects my collaborators' accounts (as the code was committed from a shared device), the following major components were conceptualized and implemented by me:
- Designing the core architecture of the chatbot system
- Implementing NLP pipelines using the T5 transformer model
- Dataset preparation and training strategy
- Contrubting to the research paper that resulted from this project

I take full responsibility for the above parts and am happy to discuss my work further.
